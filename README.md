This basic program solves the circle of fifths for 
(tonic note) ==> (# of accidentals in major key signature) 
and (# number of accidentals in major key signature) ==> (tonic note) 
using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm. 

It also generates the diatonic notes in major scales using 
the specified key signature.
